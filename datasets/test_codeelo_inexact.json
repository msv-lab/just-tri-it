But Turtle remembers that for every integer $i$ from $1$ to $n - 1$, either $a_i = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{a_{i + 1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ or $a_{i + 1} = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{a_i}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ holds for the original sequence $a$.\n\nTurtle wants you to help him complete the sequence.

The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) — the length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a'_1, a'_2, \\ldots, a'_n$ ($a'_i = -1$ or $1 \\le a'_i \\le 10^8$) — the elements of the sequence $a'$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput specification:\nFor each test case, if there is no sequence $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ that satisfies all of the conditions, output a single integer $-1$.\n\nOtherwise, output $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ — the elements of the sequence $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ you find. The sequence should satisfy that $1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$ for every integer $i$ from $1$ to $n$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case, $[4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3]$ can also be the answer, while $[4, 2, 5, 10, 5, 2, 1, 3]$ and $[4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4]$ cannot.\n\nIn the second test case, $[1, 2, 5, 2]$ can also be the answer.\n\nFrom the fourth to the sixth test cases, it can be shown that there is no answer, so you should output $-1$.\n"

They decided to construct a permutation$^{\\dagger}$ of length $n$.\n\nFor the permutation, Noobish_Monk came up with the following function: $g(i)$ is the sum of all the numbers in the permutation on a prefix of length $i$ that are not greater than $m$. Similarly, Gorilla came up with the function $f$, where $f(i)$ is the sum of all the numbers in the permutation on a prefix of length $i$ that are not less than $k$. A prefix of length $i$ is a subarray consisting of the first $i$ elements of the original array.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$, $m = 2$, $k = 5$, and the permutation is $[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]$, then:\n\n  * $f(1) = 5$, because $5 \\ge 5$; $g(1) = 0$, because $5 > 2$;    * $f(2) = 5$, because $3 < 5$; $g(2) = 0$, because $3 > 2$;    * $f(3) = 5$, because $4 < 5$; $g(3) = 0$, because $4 > 2$;    * $f(4) = 5$, because $1 < 5$; $g(4) = 1$, because $1 \\le 2$;    * $f(5) = 5$, because $2 < 5$; $g(5) = 1 + 2 = 3$, because $2 \\le 2$. \n\nHelp them find a permutation for which the value of $\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n f(i) - \\sum_{i=1}^n g(i)\\right)$ is maximized.\n\n$^{\\dagger}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in any order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation (as $2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation (as $n=3$, but $4$ appears in the array).\n\nInput specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$)  — the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each case contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($2\\le n \\le 10^5$; $1 \\le m < k \\le n$) — the size of the permutation to be constructed and two integers.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput specification:\nFor each test case, output the permutation  — a set of numbers that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq m \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$) — the number of houses and roads in Pelican Town respectively.\n\nIn each of the next $m$ lines, three integers $u$, $v$, and $c$ ($1 \\leq u, v \\leq n, c = 0/1$) are given — the ends of the road and whether an NPC is on this road. If $c = 1$, then the road has an NPC. If $c = 0$, then the road has no NPC.\n\nThe graph may contain multiple edges and loops, and if there are multiple edges with NPCs standing on them, the route must follow each of these roads.\n\nIt is guaranteed that you can reach any house from any other by walking on the roads with NPCs only.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and $m$ for all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput specification:\nFor each test case, if there is no solution, then output \"No\" (without quotes).\n\nOtherwise, output \"Yes\" (without quotes), and then output $k$ — the number of roads in the route. In the next line, output $k + 1$ numbers — the houses of the route in the order of traversal. Note that the first house should match the last one, as the route is cyclic.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\n\nYou can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nNote:\nNote that in the third test case, there are multiple edges $(5, 2)$. You must walk on two of them.\n"

There are $n$ different types of cards in their card game. Alice currently has a card of type $1$ and needs a card of type $n$ to escape Wonderland. The other players have one of each kind of card.\n\nIn this card game, Alice can trade cards with the three other players. Each player has different preferences for the $n$ types of cards, which can be described by permutations$^{\\text{∗}}$ $q$, $k$, and $j$ for the Queen, King, and Jack, respectively.\n\nA player values card $a$ more than card $b$ if for their permutation $p$, $p_a > p_b$. Then, this player is willing to trade card $b$ to Alice in exchange for card $a$. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card $a$ more than card $b$ if $a > b$, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.\n\nDetermine if Alice can trade up from card $1$ to card $n$ subject to these preferences, and if it is possible, give a possible set of trades to do it.\n\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\nInput specification:\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$) — the number of card types.\n\nThe next three lines contain the preferences of the Queen, King, and Jack respectively. Each of these lines contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ ($1\\le p_i\\le n$) — a permutation corresponding to the player's preferences.\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput specification:\nFor each test case, on the first line output a single string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice can trade up to card $n$.\n\nIf the first line was \"YES\", then on the next line output $k$ — the number of trades Alice will make. On the next $k$ lines output space separated a character $c\\in \\\\{\\texttt{q}, \\texttt{k}, \\texttt{j}\\\\}$ and integer $x$, denoting that Alice trades with player $c$ to get card $x$. It must be the case that on the $k$'th line, $x = n$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nYou can output this answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses. The same goes for the character $c$ denoting the player in the trade ($\\texttt{Q}, \\texttt{K}, \\texttt{J}$ will all be accepted alongside their lowercase variants).\n\nNote:\nIn the first testcase, Alice can trade with the King to get card $2$. She can then trade with the Queen to get card $3$.\n\nIn the second testcase, even though Alice can trade with the Queen to get card $3$, with the King to get card $2$, and then with the Jack to get card $4$, this is not a valid solution since it doesn't respect Alice's preferences. We can show that there is no way for Alice to get to card $4$.\n"

Unfortunately, she is too busy running for student council. Please solve this problem for her.\n\nGiven an integer $n$, construct a permutation $p$ of integers $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ that maximizes the value of $k$ (which is initially $0$) after the following process.\n\nPerform $n$ operations, on the $i$-th operation ($i=1, 2, \\dots, n$),\n\n  * If $i$ is odd, $k=k\\,\\&\\,p_i$, where $\\&$ denotes the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND).    * If $i$ is even, $k=k\\,|\\,p_i$, where $|$ denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).\n\nInput specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 500$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($5\\le n\\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) — the length of the permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput specification:\nFor each test case, output the maximum value of $k$ in the first line and output the permutation $p_1, p_2,\\ldots, p_n$ in the second line.\n\nIf there are multiple such permutations, output any.\n\nNote:\nFor the first test case, the value of $k$ is determined as follows:\n\n$k = 0$ initially.\n\n  * On the $1$st operation, $1$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k\\&p_1 = 0\\&2 = 0$.   * On the $2$nd operation, $2$ is even, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k|p_2 = 0|1 = 1$.   * On the $3$rd operation, $3$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k\\&p_3 = 1\\&3 = 1$.   * On the $4$th operation, $4$ is even, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k|p_4 = 1|4 = 5$.   * On the $5$th operation, $5$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k\\&p_5 = 5\\&5 = 5$.\n\nThe final value of $k$ is $5$. It can be shown that the final value of $k$ is at most $5$ for all permutations of length $5$. Another valid output is $[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]$.\n\nFor the second test case, the final value of $k$ is $7$. It can be shown that the final value of $k$ is at most $7$ for all permutations of length $6$. Other valid outputs include $[2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 5]$ and $[5, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4]$.\n"
