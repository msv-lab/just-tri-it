Description:
You are given an array $a$, consisting of $n$ integers (numbered from $1$ to $n$). Initially, they are all zeroes.

You have to process $q$ queries. The $i$-th query consists of two different integers $x_i$ and $y_i$. During the $i$-th query, you have to choose an integer $p$ (which is either $x_i$ or $y_i$) and an integer $d$ (which is either $1$ or $-1$), and assign $a_p = a_p + d$.

After each query, every element of $a$ should be a non-negative integer.

Process all queries in such a way that the sum of all elements of $a$ after the last query is the minimum possible.

Input specification:
The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$; $1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in $a$ and the number of queries, respectively.

Then $q$ lines follow. The $i$-th of these lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$; $x_i \ne y_i$) — the description of the $i$-th query.

Output specification:
For each query, print a line containing two characters:

  * the first character should be x if you choose $p=x_i$, or y if you choose $p=y_i$;    * the second character should be + if you choose $d=1$, or - if you choose $d=-1$. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
