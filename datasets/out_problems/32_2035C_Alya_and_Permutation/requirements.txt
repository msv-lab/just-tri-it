Description:
Alya has been given a hard problem. Unfortunately, she is too busy running for student council. Please solve this problem for her.

Given an integer $n$, construct a permutation $p$ of integers $1, 2, \ldots, n$ that maximizes the value of $k$ (which is initially $0$) after the following process.

Perform $n$ operations, on the $i$-th operation ($i=1, 2, \dots, n$),

  * If $i$ is odd, $k=k\,\&\,p_i$, where $\&$ denotes the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND).    * If $i$ is even, $k=k\,|\,p_i$, where $|$ denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

Input specification:
The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 500$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($5\le n\le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

Output specification:
For each test case, output the maximum value of $k$ in the first line and output the permutation $p_1, p_2,\ldots, p_n$ in the second line.

If there are multiple such permutations, output any.

Note:
For the first test case, the value of $k$ is determined as follows:

$k = 0$ initially.

  * On the $1$st operation, $1$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k\&p_1 = 0\&2 = 0$.   * On the $2$nd operation, $2$ is even, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k|p_2 = 0|1 = 1$.   * On the $3$rd operation, $3$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k\&p_3 = 1\&3 = 1$.   * On the $4$th operation, $4$ is even, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k|p_4 = 1|4 = 5$.   * On the $5$th operation, $5$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k\&p_5 = 5\&5 = 5$.

The final value of $k$ is $5$. It can be shown that the final value of $k$ is at most $5$ for all permutations of length $5$. Another valid output is $[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]$.

For the second test case, the final value of $k$ is $7$. It can be shown that the final value of $k$ is at most $7$ for all permutations of length $6$. Other valid outputs include $[2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 5]$ and $[5, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4]$.
