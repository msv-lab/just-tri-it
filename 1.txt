What's the answer when 'nth_fibonacci_number' is 0?

Given a Fibonacci number, return a list of all positive integer inputs that would produce the given Fibonacci number if passed to a standard Fibonacci function. For each possible output of the original Fibonacci function, list all corresponding positions or indices (starting from 1) that result in that Fibonacci number.

What's the answer when 'nth_fibonacci_number' is 0? Please return all possible answers in a list.
Write a Python function
    'def fiber_f_wrt_n() -> list[int]' without any input to solve the following problem.
    
    Include all necessary imports. Put the complete code inside a
    Markdown code block. Please generate the program by implementing
    only the function, without using if __name__ == "__main__": or any
    code outside the function. Please ensure the generated code
    returns pure Python types. If there are requirements for the
    output format in the problem description, please be sure to format
    it correctly.
