Polycarp has just started learning how to add numbers. As his first task, he was given two integers and asked to compute their sum.

Can you help him?

#### **Input**

The first and only line of input contains two integers \$a\$ and \$b\$ (\$-10^9 \le a, b \le 10^9\$) — the two numbers Polycarp needs to add.

#### **Output**

Print a single integer — the sum of \$a\$ and \$b\$.

#### **Examples**

**Input**

```
3 4
```

**Output**

```
7
```

**Input**

```
-5 2
```

**Output**

```
-3
```

#### **Note**

In the first example, \$3 + 4 = 7\$.
In the second example, \$-5 + 2 = -3\$.
